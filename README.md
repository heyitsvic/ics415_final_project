# ics415_final_project
Final Project for the ics415 course. The plan is to create a website that generates passwords for users. Logged
in users are able to save passwords to their account if they so desire. Guests are able to generate passwords
just as easily, but do not have the added function of saving those passwords.

Used resources for css and part of html and javascript from this tutorial:
https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app
Also used the Random package for getting random strings for the passwords:
https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/random
Used resources and package from iron-router tutorial:

Requirements:
The web site must have a sign in / login page. You should also support guests.
The web site must be uniformly styled, not just plain HTML.
The web site must be responsive. It must be usable on mobile devices.
The web site must have a navigation section and at least three ‘pages’.
The web site must have an about page that describes the technology you use in the web site.
The web site must have client side interaction.
The web site must store some information persistently.
