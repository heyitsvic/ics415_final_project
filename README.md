# ics415_final_project
Final Project for the ics415 course. The plan is to create a website that contains a log in
for users. Users are allowed to create their own accounts, where they can upload videos. Hopefully
a feature will be added that will allow previously added videos to be available to all users on the
main page. This will be done by first:

-Creating three pages and the html layout of the project, along with the design
 Bootstrap will be used to ensure that the website is usable on mobile devices.
-Add information about the technology used for the project on the third page.
-First page will display general information about the website, along with
 previously added videos.
-Second page will display user information and videos.
-Third page will display information about the technology used for the project.
-Setting up a log in for users.
-Double checking that all requirements are met.
-Bonus: Attempt to display previously added videos to the main page of the website.
-Bonus: Users should be able to click on videos from the main page and view them.

Requirements:
The web site must have a sign in / login page. You should also support guests.
